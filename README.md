# Oggle-Api
This is the starter code for the api system.

## Using this system
### Compiling
If you're using typescript then you'll need to set up your own build seuquence, however, I personally find `ts-node` to be easy to use, or just exporting the module will work fine as well.

### Running (js)
Run steps are simple, and as follows:
```
npm install
npm start
```
That's all there is to it! Provided you have the package files you should be good to go.
